Please make sure that you follow the steps below when creating an issue.
Only use GitHub issues for issues with the implementation, not for issues with specific datasets or general questions about functionality.
If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on the #keras-retinanet Slack channel instead of filing a GitHub issue.
You can find directions for the Slack channel here: https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet#discussions
